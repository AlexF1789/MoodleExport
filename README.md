This Python script can be used with the [Moodle quiz answersheet plugin](https://moodle.org/plugins/quiz_answersheets) passing to it the .txt file exported when the process starts.

### Why this script?
Basically because the original one written in JavaScript didn't work for me and I thought that creating a lighter one in Python would have taken less time than fixing the previous one.
